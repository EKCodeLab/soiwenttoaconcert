# Liftoff Group Project 2021: So I went to a concert

---

### Overview

The So I Went To A Concert app allows concert goers to document and review attendance at live musical events.

Do you struggle to remember which Grateful Dead tour you lost your ego at? Would you like to show your friends how much of a Lady Gaga super-fan you are by documenting every single concert you attended for posterity? Would you like to share photos from the awesome Master P reunion show with other fans?
